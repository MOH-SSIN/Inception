## Overview

The Inception stack runs **3 services**, each isolated in its own container.
Together they form a complete and secure web infrastructure.

#### NGINX — The Front Door

```
Internet ──► NGINX (port 443) ──► WordPress ──► MariaDB
```

**NGINX** is the only service directly accessible from the internet.
It acts as a **reverse proxy**: it receives every incoming request and decides where to send it.

- Listens exclusively on **port 443 (HTTPS)**
- All HTTP traffic is rejected — only encrypted connections are accepted
- Uses **TLSv1.2 / TLSv1.3** — modern and secure encryption protocols
- Forwards PHP requests to WordPress using the **FastCGI** protocol
- Serves static files (CSS, images, JS) directly without involving WordPress

> Think of NGINX as the **reception desk** of the infrastructure — every visitor goes through it first.

---

#### WordPress — The Website

**WordPress** is the **Content Management System (CMS)** that powers the website.
It handles all the logic: pages, posts, users, themes, and plugins.

- Runs via **PHP-FPM** (a PHP processor) — it has no built-in web server of its own
- Listens on **port 9000** (internal only — not accessible from outside)
- Communicates with MariaDB to read and write all website content
- Fully installed and configured automatically on first startup via **WP-CLI**

> Think of WordPress as the **engine** of the website — it generates the pages that users see.

---

#### MariaDB — The Database

**MariaDB** is the **relational database** that stores everything WordPress needs:
posts, pages, comments, users, settings, and plugin data.

- Listens on **port 3306** (internal only — not accessible from outside)
- Only WordPress is allowed to connect to it
- The database and its user are created automatically on first startup
- All data is stored on the host machine and persists across restarts

> Think of MariaDB as the **memory** of the website — all content lives here.

| Service     | What it does                          | Accessible from outside? | Port  |
|-------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------|
| **NGINX**   | Reverse proxy, HTTPS entry point      | Yes — port `443`         | 443   |
| **WordPress**| PHP CMS, generates web pages         | No — internal only       | 9000  |
| **MariaDB** | Database, stores all website content  | No — internal only       | 3306  |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure the following are in place on your machine or Virtual Machine:

- Docker and Docker Compose are installed and running
- The `make` command is available
- The project repository has been cloned
- Your login has been added to `/etc/hosts`:

```bash
grep "<your_login>.42.fr" /etc/hosts
# If the line is missing, add it:
echo "127.0.0.1 <your_login>.42.fr" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

- The `secrets/` directory exists at the root of the repository and contains the 4 password files:

```
secrets/
├── db_password.txt
├── db_root_password.txt
├── wp_admin_password.txt
└── wp_user_password.txt
```

If any of these files are missing, refer to the **DEV_DOC.md** to set up the environment from scratch.

### Starting the Project

All commands must be run from the **root of the repository** (the `inception/` folder).
